What is the efect of excersise on DNA?,"['Physical exercise promotes brain health and cognitive function possibly through mechanisms that include strengthened resistance to oxidative stress. However, limited research has explored the cumulative effects of regular voluntary exercise on both oxidative stress and defence mechanisms in hippocampus and cortex, two regions essential for cognitive function. Especially, adaptations in the young, healthy brain are insufficiently understood. This study investigates the impact of 8\xa0weeks of voluntary wheel running on oxidative damage and counteracting defence mechanisms in the cortex and hippocampus of young, healthy female rats. To this end, we assessed oxidative damage to proteins and DNA, antioxidant defence, and DNA repair mechanisms, focusing on the base excision repair pathway. Our findings show that 8\xa0weeks of voluntary exercise does not significantly modify oxidative damage or antioxidant defences in either cortical or hippocampal brain regions. Instead, the voluntary wheel running intervention led to a reduction in the levels of DNA polymerase β and mitochondrial apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1, key enzymes involved in base excision repair. Moreover, mitochondrial DNA copy number increased in the cortex, but decreased in the hippocampus, suggesting distinct regional adaptations. Collectively, these results indicate that the healthy young brain maintains redox homeostasis despite reduced DNA repair capacity. By analysing a comprehensive array of biomarkers in two brain regions, this study addresses gaps in our current knowledge on prolonged training and brain health and provides valuable insights into how regular exercise produces region-specific and shared responses in the healthy state.']","8 weeks of voluntary exercise does not significantly modify oxidative damage to DNA, however it led to a reduction in the levels of key enzymes involved in base excision repair of DNA.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
What was the purpose and outcome of the RISE study in relation to predicting iron biomarkers in blood donors?,"[""Machine-learning models directly predicting iron biomarkers after blood donation could help to manage donation-associated iron deficiency and avoid low haemoglobin deferrals. No such models have been externally validated internationally. Our aim was to develop and externally validate machine-learning models predicting returning blood donors' haemoglobin and ferritin. We developed machine-learning models using retrospective blood donation data. The training cohort included 2425 repeat donors (2007-09 US-based RISE study); external validation used 2014-23 cohorts from the USA, South Africa, and the Netherlands. Models predicted donors' ferritin and haemoglobin at return donations by use of variables that are commonly measured by blood collectors (time until donors return, donation history, demographics, and baseline iron biomarkers). Models were selected via cross-validation and externally validated in donors aged at least 15 years in two contexts: those with baseline ferritin and haemoglobin measured (haemoglobin and ferritin) and those with only baseline haemoglobin measured (haemoglobin only). Model performance was assessed by use of root-mean-square percentage error (RMSPE). When predicting return haemoglobin in the RISE cohort, model performance was similar in the haemoglobin and ferritin dataset (n=2625 donation visits, RMSPE=6·78) and haemoglobin only dataset (n=3488 donation visits, RMSPE=6·78). In the external datasets, containing 11\u2008000 to 514\u2008000 donations, RMSPE never increased more than 8%. When predicting return ferritin in RISE, performance was better in the haemoglobin and ferritin dataset (RMSPE=14·9) than in the haemoglobin only dataset (RMSPE=27·4). In external validation, RMSPE never increased more than 0·4% and 28% in the haemoglobin-only datasets and the haemoglobin and ferritin datasets, respectively.

what GaAs?,"['In this paper, we present the first, to the best of our knowledge, measurement of spatial Goos-Hänchen (GH) shifts for low-loss dielectrics (<i>φ</i><sub>0</sub>=<i>ε</i><sub>i</sub>/|<i>ε</i><sub>r</sub>|≪1 ). The observed resonant shifts are up to 100<i>λ</i>. Because of this sharp resonance, measuring the shift is challenging. We argue that it might be possible to use these simple materials for the many proposed applications of the GH shift. Moreover, we show that by using the GH shifts, we can discriminate materials with almost similar values of the real permittivity (<i>ε</i><sub>r</sub>) but of different imaginary values (<i>ε</i><sub>i</sub>), in our case, the bulk gallium arsenide (GaAs) versus silicon (Si). This allows us to put forth a method to measure the complex permittivity of low-loss dielectrics through the GH shifts. Using this method, the measured permittivity values for Si and GaAs differ from standard values by as little as 0.2% for the real <i>ε</i> component and 7% for the imaginary <i>ε</i> component. Further precise and accurate measurement of GH shift will result in an alternative method to measure the permittivity of materials with almost similar real permittivities.']","GaAs refers to bulk gallium arsenide, which has been used in experiments to measure spatial Goos-Hänchen shifts and complex permittivity, allowing for discrimination from materials like silicon with similar real permittivity values but different imaginary values.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
What is CO2 reduction used for?,"['Electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2ER) into fuels is a crucial strategy for mitigating climate change and meeting sustainable energy demands. Among catalytic materials, copper stands out due to its ability to convert CO2 into a diverse range of hydrocarbons and oxygenates with significant current density. Quantum mechanical studies have greatly advanced our understanding of CO2ER on copper surfaces; however, most have focused on thermodynamics and/or kinetics to elucidate reaction mechanisms or explain experimental trends, leaving orbital-level insights largely unexplored. In this study, we employed density functional theory calculations combined with intrinsic bond orbital analysis to track orbital evolution across 13 protonation steps involved in CO2ER to methane. Based on these results, we constructed an arrow-pushing diagram to illustrate the electron flow for each step. This methodology allows us to identify the key orbital used by each CO2ER intermediate to accommodate the transferred proton. Furthermore, this approach also reveals that the copper electrode actively participates in six protonation steps by exchanging pairs of electrons with CO2ER intermediates that are either selectivity-determining or rate-determining steps. These insights deepen our understanding of CO2ER mechanisms and provide a foundation for developing strategies to enhance its efficiency and selectivity.']",Electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2ER) is used for mitigating climate change and meeting sustainable energy demands by converting CO2 into fuels such as hydrocarbons and oxygenates.,single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
What triggers radiation-induced cardiac remodeling?,"['Radiation-induced cardiac remodeling (RICR) is one of the complications of exposure to radiotherapy. These disorders may occur for a subset of cancer patients, when the heart remains in part or in full in the radiation field.

RICR includes complex pathophysiological processes, which can be initiated by oxidative stress and cardiomyocyte cell death and continue with inflammation, arrhythmia, vascular and valvular abnormalities, and fibrosis, collectively contributing to structural and functional changes in the heart. Some studies have suggested strategies for RICR encompass pharmacological interventions, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, natural products, antioxidants, and others, which aim to mitigate cardiac damage and improve outcomes. Advanced therapies, including stem cell and gene therapy, as well as some adjuvants and novel drugs targeting specific molecular pathways, represent future directions for treatment.

However, evaluation of these noninvasive adjunctive techniques has not been performed in primary health care settings. Since the first point-of-contact of individuals living in rural and semiurban areas are the primary health care workers, evaluation of these noninvasive adjuncts is likely to assist and strengthen the population-wide oral cancer screening in high-burden countries such as India.

Change in Jankovic Rating Scale (JRS) was the primary outcome. Adverse events, duration to maximum response, and latency to first response were secondary outcomes. A total of 384 patients with 2657 injections for HFS patients and 1033 injections for BEB patients were reported across six studies. The mean difference analysis for the change in JRS scores in HFS patients reveals a statistically significant difference favouring the pretarsal group for improved JRS ratings (MD=0.47, CI= 0.19 to 0.75, P = 0.001) and change in JRS scores in BEB patients favouring the pretarsal group (MD=0.92, CI= 0.48 to 1.36, P 0.001). There was a significant difference favouring the pretarsal group in duration of maximum response in HFS (P= 0.0005) and fewer occurrences of ptosis (P=0.0009).

A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and an electronic search was conducted to identify all studies comparing outcomes between the two techniques. Change in Jankovic Rating Scale (JRS) was the primary outcome. Adverse events, duration to maximum response, and latency to first response were secondary outcomes. A total of 384 patients with 2657 injections for HFS patients and 1033 injections for BEB patients were reported across six studies. The mean difference analysis for the change in JRS scores in HFS patients reveals a statistically significant difference favouring the pretarsal group for improved JRS ratings (MD=0.47, CI= 0.19 to 0.75, P = 0.001) and change in JRS scores in BEB patients favouring the pretarsal group (MD=0.92, CI= 0.48 to 1.36, P 0.001).
